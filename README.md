# ICW-Friendly eBay Links Creator
This web extension converts eBay links to ICW-friendly BB-code links incl. affiliation program information. The link is created by double-clicking somewhere in the eBay item page. If successful, a notification is presented to you and you can paste the BB code directly out of the clipboard into ICW.
And for all, who don't know ICW, just to quote Leo:
> Welcome to [IbanezCollectors.com](https://ibanezcollectors.com/)! 8) THE place to talk all about Ibanezzes! 8)
And when we talk about Ibanez, then we talk about [vintage Ibanez guitars](https://www.ibanezcollectors.com/forum/) most of the time.
# Video Tutorial
The following video shows you how to fetch the link of an eBay item and how to paste it on ICW forums:

# Current limitations
This web extension is limited to use in Firefox for now. Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chromium, Chrome, Edge, etc.) are not supported yet.
# Installation
For now, download the release from here: (https://github.com/hztirf/affiliation-bblink-creator-extension/releases/tag/v1)
Then install it manually in Firefox. If you don't know how, please don't do it for now. In future, I'll think of releasing this web extension via Mozilla's add-on page officially, so you can download and activate it directly from Firefox.
